    "way to manage the risk that rising prices adversely affect the balance sheet. Suppose the airline\n",

    "how to hedge the price risk on 100 million gallons of jet fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many pieces to this that a complete analysis could be much longer than\n",
    "one homework assignment. The instructions leave room for your interpretation and preference of\n",
    "what a good approach to each part is, but you should not feel the need to provide quantitative\n",
    "justification for each decision that must be made. Rather I hope that you just take the opportunity\n",

    "## Rolling Hedge Strategy with Heating Oil Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Hedge: Rolling HO Contracts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on data available as of January 2, 2024, I would recommend implementing a rolling hedge using liquid near-dated heating oil (HO) contracts rather than locking into a single far-dated month. The rationale is straightforward: nearby contracts (February 2024 through early 2025) exhibit significantly higher trading volume and open interest compared to late-2025 expiries, which directly translates into tighter bid-ask spreads and substantially lower execution risk per trade. While a single long-dated contract (such as December 2025) might appear simpler by avoiding roll-date uncertainty, it concentrates your entire position in a thinly traded instrument where spreads are wider, market depth is sparse, and the correlation with spot jet fuel tends to be weaker—ultimately increasing both basis risk and execution costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution plan would involve sizing the total hedge using your estimated beta coefficient and the 100-million-gallon exposure (approximately β × 2,381 HO contracts), then mapping that notional into a schedule matching your expected monthly or quarterly fuel consumption. Starting January 2, 2024, you would enter positions in the front few active contracts and systematically roll them forward—closing expiring contracts 2–3 weeks before first notice and opening the next month's contracts to maintain a constant β-weighted hedge ratio through November 2025. Historical data through 2023 consistently shows that front-month HO contracts maintain stronger correlation with jet fuel spot prices and deliver lower hedge-error volatility than far-dated contracts. When you simulate rolling strategies versus holding a single long-dated position over comparable past horizons, the rolling approach demonstrates superior combined performance once you account for both basis risk and execution slippage, making it the more prudent choice for managing a large exposure over an extended period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary Hedge: Jet–Heating Oil Spread Futures**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the main hedge is in place using heating oil futures, the jet–heating oil spread future is a natural way to manage the remaining difference between jet fuel and heating oil prices.\n",
    "- A long position in HO futures hedges the common risk, but it does not perfectly hedge movements in the jet–HO basis.\n",
    "- The ME spread future, which is structurally tied to that basis, lets you add a second leg that more directly targets the jet-minus-HO component of price risk.\n",
    "- In practice, you would size the HO leg first using your estimated hedge ratio between jet fuel and HO, based only on data available up to January 2, 2024.\n",
    "- Then, using the history of the jet–HO spread and ME prices up to that date, you can estimate how sensitive the jet–HO basis is to the spread future and choose a smaller ME position that reduces the volatility of the residual hedge error."

    "- Analyzed 457 overlapping jet–HO price days with 456 daily P&L observations over the hedge window\n",
    "- Unhedged daily jet-fuel P&L standard deviation: ~$4.7 million\n",
    "- Hedged P&L standard deviation: ~$330 million—almost two orders of magnitude larger\n",
    "- Total unhedged P&L over window: –$7.7 million\n",
    "- Total hedged P&L over window: –$273.7 million\n",
    "- The hedge massively amplified risk rather than dampening it, effectively turning the position into a speculative bet on HO contracts\n",
    "- \n",
    "**End-of-Period Basis Analysis (October 30, 2025)**\n",
    "- Jet fuel spot price: $2.256 per gallon\n",
    "- HO futures price: $2.4265 per gallon\n",
    "- Ex-post basis (jet – HO): approximately –$0.1705 per gallon (jet fuel cheaper than heating oil by ~17 cents)\n",
    "- The negative basis meant the long HO futures position was losing money when the spot jet fuel exposure was not particularly painful\n",
    "- This divergence between HO and jet fuel prices made the hedge costly and increased P&L variability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "- The HO hedge specification performed poorly: the estimated hedge ratio and front-month HO futures did a poor job tracking the airline's realized jet fuel costs\n",
    "- Rather than reducing risk, the hedge increased the variability of the airline's effective fuel costs"

    "- No, the airline likely lost money on the HO futures hedge\n",
    "- The negative basis at period-end (jet fuel $0.1705/gallon cheaper than HO) means the long HO futures position was underwater relative to jet fuel spot prices\n",
    "- The airline was long HO futures to hedge long jet fuel exposure, but HO prices rose relative to jet fuel, creating losses on the futures leg that exceeded any spot market benefits\n",
    "\n",

    "- No. A hedge can be justified, even if it loses money ex-post, as long as it at least managed to stabilize total costs (through reduced PnL volatility)\n",
    "- However, this *particular* hedge failed on its own terms: it increased volatility ($330M vs $4.7M standard deviation) rather than reducing it\n",
    "- The justification for hedging in general remains valid; the justification for *this specific HO hedge design* does not, as it amplified rather than dampened risk\n",
    "- A well-designed hedge should have reduced P&L volatility even if it resulted in net losses—the issue here is implementation failure, not the hedging concept itself"

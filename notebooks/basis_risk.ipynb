    "# Hedging risks\n",

    "The point of this assignment is to assess the risks of using futures to hedge exposure to jet fuel prices\n",
    "for an airline and, more generally, to see how futures may not align with asset risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the largest expenses for an airline is jet fuel, and futures are one possible\n",
    "way to manage the risk that rising prices adversely affect the balance sheet. Suppose the airline\n",
    "has already done demand modeling and determined that it will need about 100 million gallons of\n",
    "jet fuel for this month (November 2025). Suppose it is January 2024, and they must decide\n",
    "how to hedge the price risk on 100 million gallons of jet fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many pieces to this that a complete analysis could be much longer than\n",
    "one homework assignment. The instructions leave room for your interpretation and preference of\n",
    "what a good approach to each part is, but you should not feel the need to provide quantitative\n",
    "justification for each decision that must be made. Rather I hope that you just take the opportunity\n",
    "to work through the process to see the components of risk, their relative scale, and the quantitative\n",
    "and modeling decisions needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE/WARNING: The splicing methods in `finm37000` do not handle splicing when roll dates do\n",
    "not have data for both contracts. Databento `ohlcv-1d` data rolls on UTC dates and may contain\n",
    "weekend data for one contract and not the other. If you would like to use that data and these\n",
    "splicing methods, you should probably explicitly force the use of weekday data only.\n",
    "Other data sources and splicing methods are acceptable too and may not face this issue.\n"
